<p>The concept of <span style="color:darkmagenta" font weight="bold">prettiness </span>is one that has plaughed females all over the world.
    We as people should be the change that we want to experience so that our children
    will not have to live in a world that expects them to be something they are not.<br> The poem above 
    expands on the notion of beauty.
